# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements

You will need to install npm to work on this app.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo to your pc and run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

It is highly recommended that you install the ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native Snippets extension by dsznajder for vs code.
This allows one to type short-hand to generate boilerplate code.

```ex: rfc - creates a react functional component which is what most of this site will be made out of.```

### Repo Structure

Due to a limit with react, all project names must be lowercase and so I've added a folder called aottgwiki for the actual site.

Project is separated into Components and Routes. These can be found under src/components and src/routes. Each is a react functional component but
separated for the purpose of identifying reusable code (which should only be put under components).

Assets will be located under public/assets.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
