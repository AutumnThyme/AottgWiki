# AottgWiki
A wiki for the undying Chinese web browser game made by Fenglee.

## Dev Environment Setup Can Be Found Under AottgWiki/aottgwiki/README.md

## Workflow file builds the project and deploys it to github pages so that other project members can see work after each push of code to main.

## I highly recommend the use of github desktop if you are unfamiliar with using git through a terminal.
